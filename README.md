An enlightened anon once said and with that idea I hope to find similar people wishing to help out this archival purpose of our endangered weeb content with some of the scummiest traitors to the weeb scene along side a complacent and nonchalant furry admin, since there is so much just one person can do, both for time and financial reasons.

# Where are you going to organize?

To the chagrin of some certain people, my main center of operations is my own group discord server: https://discord.unclebane.xyz/ so if you wish to hit me up, discuss stuff and the works you are welcome to message me there, there isn't any other place I'm active most of the time.

# So are you all talk and no dance? or have you done something to prove what you want to do?

Why yes, I have finally started uploading big archive dumps on archive.org since unlike torrents on nyaa that dies after it stops being seeded (or low seeded is almost the same as dead) , there it should survive longer and people can download just what they need or all of it, here are some of the stuff I have already archived, before you complain why the dump not being in just 1 archive, I'm afraid that archive.org html5 uploader doesn't vibe with some stuff for some reason, like ogm files or just trying to upload 500+ GB of content in 1 go.

My dumps of mainly original rips, not-upscaled, not website-watermarked (like the cancer's of HHeaven or HAnime) Hentai Anime OVAs (basically most of them where used for the Ed2k-hash for anidb back, this will be important for this archival effort Soonâ„¢) :

In the odd chance you like what I'm doing here and you wish to help me out financially paying for the server I'm using for this stuff and any future usage for this project and you have the power for it, you are welcome to drop me a few bucks over https://donate.unclebane.xyz/ , otherwise you getting people help out building up this archival project is more than enough, thank you.
